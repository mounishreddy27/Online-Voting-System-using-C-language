# Online Voting System using C language

This project is an implementation of an Online Voting System using C programming language. It allows users to register as voters, cast their votes, view the list of candidates, display the winner, and check the votes secured by each candidate. Additionally, it supports voter deregistration.


## Features:

* Registration: Users can register as voters by providing their name, age, and Aadhaar number. If the user's age is 18 or above, they are eligible for registration. Each registered voter is assigned a unique Voter ID.

* CastVote: Registered voters can cast their votes by entering their Voter ID and Aadhaar number. After successful verification, the system displays the list of candidates, and the user can choose their preferred candidate by entering the candidate number. Each voter can only cast one vote.

* List of Candidates: The system provides a list of candidates participating in the election, along with their corresponding candidate numbers.

* Winner: The system allows authorized users (with the correct password) to view the winner of the election. The candidate with the highest number of votes is declared the winner.

* Votes Secured by Each Candidate: Authorized users can view the number of votes secured by each candidate in the election.

* Deregistration: Registered voters can choose to deregister by entering their Voter ID. Upon deregistration, their voter details are removed from the system.
